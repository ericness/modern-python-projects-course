# Making `pyenv-win` work with VS Code in Windows

At the time of recording this course, VS Code has some problems with discovering Python versions installed with `pyenv-win`. However, there is an experimental feature that solves this issues, so maybe if you are watching it in the future, you won't have this problem.
â€¨
So, if you are a Windows user and you don't see Python versions installed with `pyenv-win` when you run the "Python: Select Interpreter" command, follow the instruction from [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/15304):

- Open the VS Code settings
- Search for *Python > Experiments: Opt Into* option and click *Edit in settings.json*:

- This will open your settings file. Inside the "python.experiments.optInto" add "pythonDiscoveryModule", so it looks like this:

- Reload VS Code
- Now, when you run "Python: Select Interpreter", you should see Python versions installed with `pyenv-win`:

**Important**: If you don't see the "Python > Experiments: Opt Into" option, make sure you use the **latest version of VS Code** and that you set up `pyenv-win` correctly, including **setting up the PYENV environment variables** as explained in the installation instructions: [https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#finish-the-installation](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#finish-the-installation)

If that still doesn't work, there is the hard way of pointing VS Code to a specific Python version:

- Run the "Python: Select Interpreter" command
- Select "I can't find the interpreter I want to select ..."
- Manually browse to the python.exe file installed with `pyenv-win`. By default it should be inside `.pyenv\pyenv-win\versions\<version-number>\python.exe` (for me it was `c:\Users\switowski\.pyenv\pyenv-win\versions\3.8.1\python.exe`):
